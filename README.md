# _SolveIt._
### Introduction
Welcome to SolveIt !!!  

SolveIt as of now is a  purely python based application that solves problems
based on engineering grade mathematics.  
As of now I have only covered 3 topics, _Integration, Differentiation,_ and _Eigen
Values and Vectors_.

I wish to add more modules to the code as soon as possible and deploy it as a Desktop application in the near future and the final goal would be to deploy a Mobile application for the same.

### Tech used
I have only used python for this project but I understand that I would have to use other languages in order to deploy it as a mobile app.  
I have made use of the SymPy library to return symbolic values and Tkinter for the GUI.
Currently the Eigen value and vector function is limited to matrices with distinct eigen values only, this will be fixed soon.
